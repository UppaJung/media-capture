# Commissions Corrupt Coverage

<!-- To grasp the severity of the problem consider the analog of pharmaceuticals. -->
Would you trust newspapers that promote potentially-hazardous products with headlines like ‘*Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You*’?

Would you trust them less if their articles only quoted sources working in the industry that produces antidepressants?

What if the industry paid them a commission each time readers bought antidepressants?

This is how tech products are covered today. The New York Times has, in fact, published an article with the headline [‘*Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You*’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) in its Wirecutter section; CNET has implored [‘*Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It*’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget has urged [‘*You need a password manager -- right now*’](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); and PCWorld has explained [‘*Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough*’](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) (your browser's password manager is free and offers no affiliate commissions).

All these news organizations collect commissions from the sellers of password managers when readers click on the links to buy them.[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]

[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]: The New York Times WireCutter's [‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) does not have direct affiliate links, but directs readers to another of their articles, [‘The Best Password Managers’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/) which contains purchasing links. Similarly, CNET's [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/) links to their [rankings of the password managers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/) with purchasing links that pay commissions. Engadget and PCWorld embedded affiliate links directly into the articles promoting the product category.

Like pharmaceuticals, tech products can be hazardous and those persuaded to buy them may be harmed. The readers most clearly harmed from news articles about password managers may be those convinced to buy LastPass. In 2022, attackers were able to steal LastPass's online databases of all their users' data, including each user's database of stored passwords. That theft was particularly harmful because LastPass had failed to design their software to encrypt some of that data, and the encryption they used to protect users' passwords was woefully substandard. Both flaws had been exposed in 2018 by Wladimir Palant, a well-known security researcher.[^lastpass-iterations] For some users, LastPass's failure to fix these flaws likely caused all their passwords to be compromised. Nearly all other users needed to urgently change their passwords for every account they had stored in LastPass.

Many victims had chosen LastPass because it had been widely recommended despite its known security flaws and a prior breach in 2015. Among those that recommended it were The New York Times[^nyt-lastpass-rec]; PCWorld, which awarded it ‘*Best Overall*’ password manager in 2021; and CNET, which awarded it ‘*Best paid password manager*’ in 2021.[^wired-notes-security] Positive coverage helped LastPass accumulate one of the largest shares of the password manager market, if not *the* largest[^lastpass-market-share], despite the company's poor security track record.
 <!-- Commissions surely helped drive that coverage. -->

[^nyt-lastpass-rec]: The free edition of LastPass was recommended by The New York Times WireCutter prior its developer's acquisition by private equity in 2019, which completed in 2020. I could not isolate when The New York Times stopped recommending it because The New York Times only shows updated versions of articles and the 2019 and 2020 versions of the article could not be found via [archive.org](archive.org).

News organizations, including The New York Times, claim that coverage is not driven by commissions and that “[the most important thing to us is reader trust](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/).” They do so by equating trust with their editorial staff's ability to compare products *within* a category without bias.[^editorial-independence] This is misdirection.

Rather, commissions may bias both the quantity and the sentiment of coverage for entire product categories. Lucrative commissions create an incentive to give a product category more coverage and to make coverage of that category more favorable. It's no wonder that lucrative products like password managers generate so much coverage, and so much of it positive.

Commissions also discourage coverage of products' safety. Investigating safety is expensive, as much more expertise and time are required to research how a product might fail than to check off the product's features. Since the mention of one product's hazards can dampen readers' enthusiasm for an entire product category, safety coverage also incurs a cost in reduced commissions. It's no wonder coverage of password managers so often glosses over their hazards.

Commissions can corrupt even if every member of the editorial staff believes themselves editorially independent, by encouraging the hiring of staff tasked with covering lucrative products on short deadlines and discouraging the hiring of staff skilled in scrutinizing product safety. Commissions can corrupt even if news organizations do not intentionally bias themselves in favor of lucrative product categories, simply because those organizations inclined to provide more coverage of lucrative categories, and inclined to make more of it positive, will be more profitable and more likely to survive in the competitive marketplace than organizations less inclined to do so. The evolutionary forces that result from commission-based coverage erode the trustworthiness of the news media, and will continue to do so until we reject the premise that commission-based coverage can be trustworthy.

The extent to which commissions have already allowed industry to capture the media, and undermined trust, is evident from the sheer volume of articles promoting hazardous products while disregarding their risks.

To restore our trust, news organizations will need to give up their willful ignorance of the potential for commissions to bias product coverage and harm the public. Those organizations that continue accepting commissions should disclose every penny they receive from every affiliate link. Investigative journalists should follow the money that is not disclosed. A good place to start would be the tens of millions of dollars that may have been paid to the news organizations that recommended LastPass.[^money-flow]

[^editorial-independence]: [The New York Times Wirecutter about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) states “the decisions we make regarding the products we feature on our site are always driven by editorial and product testing standards, not by affiliate deals or advertising relationships” and asserts “total editorial independence”. Their [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims a “strict separation between Commerce and Editorial”. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims “editorial independence” because [“Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.”](https://www.pcworld.com/about/affiliate-link-policy) Even [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/), the gold standard in product coverage that insists on buying the products it reviews and touts being “Ad-free. Influence-free. Powered by consumers.”, collects affiliate commissions, including via their links to recommended password managers. While LastPass was not among their recommendations for 2023-05-12, their review of LastPass still rated it “Excellent in data security” despite all the evidence to the contrary.


[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.

[^lastpass-iterations]: See Wladimir Palant's 2018 [Is your LastPass data really safe in the encrypted online vault?](https://palant.info/2018/07/09/is-your-lastpass-data-really-safe-in-the-encrypted-online-vault/) and post-breach article [LastPass breach: The significance of these password iterations](https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/),

[^lastpass-best]: Contact me for archival copies of both articles if necessary. At the time of writing, the [PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) was still online with the recommendation unchanged and the [CNET article was available via the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707100536/https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/).

[^wired-notes-security]: To the credit of Wired, author Lily Hay Newman did mention as early as [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20200612063257/https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/) that “The main drawback to LastPass is its mixed security track record—the product has had a number of high-profile, critical bugs and there have even been some data breaches. Overall, LastPass has weathered these storms, but it's worth noting.” (The act of “weathering the storms” does not appear to have included fixing the problems reported.)

[^money-flow]: The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship LastPass and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that over ten million dollars was paid to those recommending LastPass in the year before the breach alone.
