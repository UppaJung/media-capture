# Commissions Corrupt Coverage

<!-- To grasp the severity of the problem consider the analog of pharmaceuticals. -->
Would you trust newspapers that promote potentially-hazardous products with headlines like ‘*Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You*’?

Would you trust them less if their articles only quoted sources working in the industry that produces antidepressants?

What if they received a commission each time readers bought antidepressants?

This is how tech products are covered today. The New York Times has, in fact, published an article with the headline [‘*Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You*’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) in its Wirecutter section; CNET has implored [‘*Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It*’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget has urged [‘*You need a password manager -- right now*’](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); and for readers who might tempted to use the free password manager built into their browser, PCWorld has explained [‘*Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough*’](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html).

All these news organizations receive commissions from the sellers of password managers when readers click on the links to buy them.[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]

[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]: The New York Times WireCutter's [‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) does not have direct affiliate links, but directs readers to another of their articles, [‘The Best Password Managers’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/) which contains purchasing links. Similarly, CNET's [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/) links to their [rankings of the password managers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/) with purchasing links that pay commissions. Engadget and PCWorld embedded affiliate links directly into the articles promoting the product category.

Like pharmaceuticals, the products produced by the tech industry can indeed be hazardous, as readers who were persuaded by those articles to buy the password manager LastPass have learned. In 2022 attackers breached the servers on which LastPass stored all of their users' password databases. That theft was particularly harmful because LastPass had failed to design their software to encrypt some user data they stored online, and the encryption they used to protect users' was woefully substandard. Both flaws had been exposed in 2018 by Wladimir Palant, a well-known security researcher.[^lastpass-iterations] The failure of LastPass to fix these flaws resulted in the compromise of some users' passwords. Nearly all other users needed to replace every password they had stored in LastPass, and do so as quickly as possible.

Many victims had chosen LastPass because it had been widely recommended despite its known security flaws and a prior breach in 2015. Among those that recommended it were The New York Times[^nyt-lastpass-rec]; PCWorld, which which awarded it ‘*Best Overall*’ password manager in 2021; and CNET, which awarded it ‘*Best paid password manager*’ in 2021. Positive coverage despite the company's poor security track record helped LastPass accumulate one of the largest shares of the password manager market, if not *the* largest.[^lastpass-market-share]

[^nyt-lastpass-rec]: The free edition of LastPass was recommended by The New York Times WireCutter prior its developer's acquisition by private equity in 2019, which completed in 2020. I could not isolate when The New York Times stopped recommending it because The New York Times only shows updated versions of articles and the 2019 and 2020 versions of the article could not be found via [archive.org](archive.org).

News organizations that receive commissions claim coverage is not driven by affiliate deals[^not-affiliate-deals], that “[the most important thing to us is reader trust](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/).” They equate trust with their editorial staff's ability to fairly rank one product over another.[^editorial-independence]

Yet the trustworthiness of coverage is still compromised by commissions, as they encourage more coverage of product categories that pay large commissions, and bias that coverage to favor purchasing a product within that category over alternatives that do not require a purchase. Commissions also discourage investigation into safety, not just because investigating harms is quite costly, but because merely mentioning potential harms in some products can dampen enthusiasm for the entire product category.

The voluminous news articles ranking password managers, almost all of which explain the necessity of these products while glossing over their safety, clearly demonstrate how commission-based coverage allows industry to capture the media and undermines our trust in the media.

To restore our trust, news organizations must end their willful ignorance of the potential for commissions to bias coverage and cause genuine harm. Those that continue accepting commissions should acknowledge these biases and disclose every penny they receive for each article, link, product, product category, and industry. Journalists should investigate the money flows that are not disclosed. They can start with what may have been tens of millions of dollars received each year by those who published articles recommending LastPass.[^money-flow]

[^editorial-independence]: The New York Times WireCutter [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims a “strict separation between Commerce and Editorial” and the [about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) claims “total editorial independence”. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims “editorial independence” because [“Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.”](https://www.pcworld.com/about/affiliate-link-policy) Even [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/), the gold standard in product coverage that insists on buying the products it reviews and touts being “Ad-free. Influence-free. Powered by consumers.”, collects affiliate commissions, including via their links to recommended password managers. While LastPass was not among their recommendations for 2023-05-12, their review of LastPass still rated it “Excellent in data security” despite all the evidence to the contrary.


[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.

[^lastpass-iterations]: See Wladimir Palant's 2018 [Is your LastPass data really safe in the encrypted online vault?](https://palant.info/2018/07/09/is-your-lastpass-data-really-safe-in-the-encrypted-online-vault/) and post-breach article [LastPass breach: The significance of these password iterations](https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/),

[^lastpass-best]: Contact me for archival copies of both articles if necessary. At the time of writing, the [PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) was still online with the recommendation unchanged and the [CNET article was available via the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707100536/https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/).

[^not-affiliate-deals]: As of the time of this writing, the [Wirecutter about page]((https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) stated “And of course, the decisions we make regarding the products we feature on our site are always driven by editorial and product testing standards, not by affiliate deals or advertising relationships.”

[^wired-notes-security]: To the credit of Wired, author Lily Hay Newman did mention as early as [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20200612063257/https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/) that “The main drawback to LastPass is its mixed security track record—the product has had a number of high-profile, critical bugs and there have even been some data breaches. Overall, LastPass has weathered these storms, but it's worth noting.”

[^money-flow]: The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship LastPass and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that over ten million dollars flowed between this one product vendor and the media covering that vendor in the year before the breach alone.
