# Commissions Corrupt Coverage

<!-- To grasp the severity of the problem consider the analog of pharmaceuticals. -->
Would you trust newspapers that promote potentially-hazardous products with headlines like ‘*Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You*’?

Would you trust them less if those articles only quoted sources working in the industry that produces antidepressants?

What if they received a commission each time readers bought antidepressants?

This is how tech products are covered today. The New York Times has, in fact, published an article in its Wirecutter section with the headline [‘*Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You*’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html); CNET has implored [‘*Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It*’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget has urged [‘*You need a password manager -- right now*’](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); and for readers who might tempted to use the free password manager built into their browser, PCWorld has explained [‘*Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough*’](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html).

All these news organizations receive commissions from the sellers of password managers when readers click on the links to buy them.[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]

[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]: The New York Times WireCutter's [‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) does not have direct affiliate links, but directs readers to another of their articles, [‘The Best Password Managers’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/) which contains purchasing links. Similarly, CNET's [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/) links to their [rankings of the password managers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/) with purchasing links that pay commissions. Engadget and PCWorld embedded affiliate links directly into the articles promoting the product category.

Like pharmaceuticals, the products produced by the tech industry can indeed be hazardous, as readers who were persuaded by those articles to buy the password manager LastPass have learned. In 2022 attackers breached the servers on which LastPass stored all of their users' password databases. That theft was particularly harmful because LastPass had failed to design their software to fully encrypt users' databases before storing them online, and the encryption they did use was woefully substandard. Both flaws had been revealed by a well-respected security researcher, Wladimir Palant, in 2018.[^lastpass-iterations] For some users, these security failings led to the compromise of all their passwords. Nearly everyone else still needed to replace every password they had stored in LastPass, and do so as quickly as possible.

Many victims had chosen LastPass because it had been widely recommended in the press, including by The New York Times as recently as 2020 [^nyt-lastpass-rec] and in 2021 as PCWorld's ‘*Best Overall*’ password manager and CNET's ‘*Best paid password manager*’. Such coverage had helped LastPass accumulate one of the largest shares of the password manager market, if not *the* largest, despite known security flaws.[^lastpass-market-share] Articles continued to recommend LastPass even after an earlier breach in 2015 and even after LastPass repeatedly disregarded and failed to fix flaws identified by security researchers.  The news media covering password managers mostly ignored its known security risks, as they seemed to have no impact on its ratings.

[^nyt-lastpass-rec]: The free edition of LastPass was recommended by The New York Times WireCutter prior its developer's acquisition by private equity in 2019, which completed in 2020. I could not isolate when The New York Times stopped recommending it because The New York Times only shows updated versions of articles and the 2019 and 2020 versions of the article could not be found via [archive.org](archive.org).

News organizations that receive commissions argue we can trust them because of editorial independence, as editorial staff are “generally unaware” of the commission earned from each product.[^editorial-independence] Such independence might eliminate bias between products, especially since when most products pay commissions, the article will earn money regardless which is recommended. Their arguments overlook the true potential for bias: that which favors the purchase of products in lucrative product categories.

Commissions encourage more coverage of product categories that pay large commissions, and bias that coverage to favor purchasing a product within that category over alternatives that do not require a purchase. Commissions also discourage investigation into potential product harms, as merely raising the potential for harm can dampen enthusiasm even for those products that are well safeguarded against it. Investigating each product's safety would drastically increase the cost of producing articles while reducing revenue. The voluminous news articles ranking password managers, almost all of which explain the necessity of these products while glossing over their harms, demonstrate how commissions can allow the industry to capture the media.

<!-- See, for example, pressure cookers with escape valves. -->

To restore our trust, news organizations must end their willful ignorance of the potential for commissions to bias coverage and cause genuine harm. Those that continue accepting commissions should acknowledge these biases and disclose every penny they receive for each article, link, product, product category, and industry. Journalists should investigate the money flows that are not been disclosed. They can start with what may have been tens of millions of dollars received each year by those who published articles recommending LastPass.[^money-flow]

[^editorial-independence]: The New York Times WireCutter [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims a “strict separation between Commerce and Editorial” and the [about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) claims “total editorial independence”. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims “editorial independence” because [“Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.”](https://www.pcworld.com/about/affiliate-link-policy) Even [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/), the gold standard in product coverage that insists on buying the products it reviews and touts being “Ad-free. Influence-free. Powered by consumers.”, collects affiliate commissions, including via their links to recommended password managers. While LastPass was not among their recommendations for 2023-05-12, their review of LastPass still rated it “Excellent in data security” despite all the evidence to the contrary.


[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.

[^lastpass-iterations]: See Wladimir Palant's 2018 [Is your LastPass data really safe in the encrypted online vault?](https://palant.info/2018/07/09/is-your-lastpass-data-really-safe-in-the-encrypted-online-vault/) and post-breach article [LastPass breach: The significance of these password iterations](https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/),

[^lastpass-best]: Contact me for archival copies of both articles if necessary. At the time of writing, the [PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) was still online with the recommendation unchanged and the [CNET article was available via the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707100536/https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/).

[^wired-notes-security]: To the credit of Wired, author Lily Hay Newman did mention as early as [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20200612063257/https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/) that “The main drawback to LastPass is its mixed security track record—the product has had a number of high-profile, critical bugs and there have even been some data breaches. Overall, LastPass has weathered these storms, but it's worth noting.”

[^money-flow]: The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship LastPass and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that over ten million dollars flowed between this one product vendor and the media covering that vendor in the year before the breach alone.
